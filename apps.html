  <h1>Deal or no Deal</h1>
      <p> For my final project, my partner and I decided to remake the classic T.V. game show, Deal or no Deal. If you are unfamiliar with this game, the goal is to select the case that contains one million dollars and eliminate the rest. Throughout the game, the banker will give you offers to try and get you to end the game, to which you have to respond with “Deal” or “No Deal”. If you continue playing to the end of the game, they have one final decision, that is whether to keep your case or select the other case. Our version of the game works very similarly, so whether you are a Deal or No Deal veteran, or a brand new player, you can get the classic game show experience. To play our version of the game, all you have to do is simply hit the start button. On the top of the game screen will be your move counter, which just tells you how many cases you need to eliminate in order to go to the next round. At the bottom of the screen is the round counter and on the left side of the screen is a list of all the values that are still in play. Now all that is left to do is select your player case (it will highlight gold) and win some money.Laslty, if you would like to play again, just simply refresh the page!
