  <h1>Hello and Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
      <p> My name is Evan Fritz and contained on this website is a collection of programs that I have written during my time in CSC106.
          I created this webpage using the Html coding language, which is soon to include javascripts links written by me to other javascripts
          and apps, all created by me!
